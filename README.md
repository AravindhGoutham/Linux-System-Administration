# Linux-System-Administration
This repository contains a series of Linux system administration projects designed to improve network infrastructure, server management, and security for a fictional company, Dunder-Mifflin. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including network configuration, server hardening, DNS setup, web server management, user management, and system automation.

Key tasks include:

Networking and Hostname Configuration: Setting up static IP addresses, DHCP server configuration, and assigning functional hostnames for machines in the network.
DNS Server Configuration: Installing and configuring BIND DNS server for managing both forward and reverse DNS, as well as implementing recursive DNS and zone synchronization.
Web Server Management: Installing and configuring Apache web servers, setting up virtual hosts, and configuring backup web servers with automatic synchronization.
User and File Management: Implementing centralized user management with Ansible, ensuring consistent configurations across all machines, and managing NFS shares for secure file access.
Security and Access Control: Implementing PAM for password policy enforcement, access control, and time-based login restrictions for specific machines.
Backup and System Redundancy: Setting up NFS and RAID configurations for reliable storage, data backup, and performance optimization across servers.
Automated System Management: Using Ansible to automate system configuration tasks, synchronize server configurations, and ensure consistency across multiple machines.
Time Synchronization: Configuring NTP servers and clients to maintain synchronized time across all servers, ensuring consistency for logging and file timestamps.
These projects demonstrate practical application of advanced Linux system administration techniques, emphasizing automation, security, and network management in a multi-server environment.
